    <h1>Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering -Texas Tech University, Whitacre College of Engineering</h1>
    <P>I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum engineering at TTU where students get hands-on experience learning the
        broad-based discipline that focuses on the
        development, exploration, conservation, and transportation of oil and gas resources. Petroleum engineers plan
        and supervise drilling and well-completion programs, design and select drilling and production equipment,
        estimate reserves, and manage oil and gas properties. Our main duties were: analysing geological data,
        interpreting well-logging results (records of the geological formations located by drilling boreholes) to
        ascertain resource potential, designing methods of extracting oil and gas safely and efficiently using
        specialist computer applications and mathematical models
        ascertaining extraction risks, such as an areaâ€™s potential for earthquakes ,supervising extraction sites,
        selecting and maintaining equipment, monitoring and evaluating the performance of extraction sites.
        managing projects and keeping accurate records of problems and progress, liaising with and advising managerial
        and technical staff, including geologists and contractors.</P>

    <p>My first job out of college was a Field Engineering Role and the main skills I acquired are:
        <li>strong technical skills</li>
        <li>analytical skills</li>
        <li>teamworking skills</li>
        <li>the ability to solve complex problems</li>
        <li>the ability to work under pressure</li>
        <li>project management skills</li>

    <h1>Master's of Business Administration -Texas Tech University, Rawls College of Business</h1>
    <p>My second Degree is a postgraduate degree focused on business administration. Our core courses in an MBA program
        covered various
        areas of business administration such as accounting, applied statistics, human resources, business
        communication,
        business ethics, business law, strategic management, business strategy, finance, management, Business analytics, Information systems,
        entrepreneurship, marketing, supply-chain management, and operations management in a manner most relevant to
        management analysis and strategy. Owning an MBA program helped me hone skills you already have from
        previous work experience, and to upskill in new areas as I find your feet in the business world.
        When embarking on my business school journey, it was improtatnt to gain a range of soft skills,
        including non-technical skills or non-engineering skills, alongside the equally valuable hard skills.
        Gaining a blend of these skills helped ensure that I can tackle whatever comes my way in the
        business world. This also means that you do not need to be an engineer or be well versed in technical skills to
        be successful at business school. It helped me become a well-rounded individual. </p>
    <p>My STEM MBA helped me acquire or strengthen the following skills:
        <li>Time Management</li>
        <li>Interpersonal skills and emotional Intelligence</li>
        <li>Problem solving and decision making Decision making</li>
        <li>Leadership and management </li>
        <li>Communication</li>
        <li>entrepreneurship and Innovation</li>
