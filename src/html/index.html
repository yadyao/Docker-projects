    <p>My name is Marie Yao and I always dreamed of traveling the world and getting my degree while
        experiencing another culture. My favorite subject in school was science, and it was a lightbulb moment when my
        chemistry teacher conducted a presentation on petroleum chemical products, oil extraction and production. It was
        with no hesitation that I joined petroleum engineering undergraduate program at Texas Tech after accepting an
        international scholarship along with Prize of the Inter-African Conference of Majors as part of the Excellence
        Banquet of the Essor group (one of my biggest achievements to date).
        Upon getting my petroleum bachelors degree, I joined the workforce as Fracking Field Engineer and became one of
        the supervisors of my frack team. This leadership role helped me learn to listen to and address major
        concerns, manage difficult situations and empower my team members. The Covid 19 pandemic slow down gave me the
        best opportunities to further my education. I joined a Devops Engineer course and I started working at
        <a href="http://mylandmarktech.com/">Landmark Technologies</a> for almost 4 years.
    </p>
    <p> I have learned the following tools:
        <li>Linux</li>
        <li>Git and Github</li>
        <li>Maven</li>
        <li>Sonarqube</li>
        <li>Nexus</li>
        <li>Jenkins</li>
        <li>Docker</li>
        <li>Kubernetes</li>
        <li>Terraform</li>
        <li>Ansible</li>
    </p>
    <p> I started the STEM MBA program in Fall 2020, still at Texas Tech University.The program was amazing with
        multiple interesting courses that completely broadened my horizon. The most
        impactful classes to me were Decision Theory and business Analytics and Leadership and Ethics.That course
        introduced me to normative and behavorial aspects of managerial decision making as they relate to business
        analytics and the broader managerial landscape. The course material provided theory underlying decision-making
        behaviorand includes applications to various decision-making problems. Decision-making is a key skill in all business disciplines and in life, and that class was tdesigned to teach us fundamental concepts and  While I had the
        opportunity to join the oil and gas industry after my MBA, I decided to take a business-related job offer at
        Dell Technologies where I work currently work as an inside Product Specialist. That role required a
        perfect mix of my technical background and my business acumen. It also helped me to up my server game.
    </p>
    <p>Overall, I am a skilled Devops Engineer with around 4 years solid hands-on experience in automating the
        deployment of mission critical applications over varying infrastructure as well as managing IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
        I am highly proficient with Source Code Management, Configuration Management using Ansible, Orchestration
        Management, Infrastructure Management and CI/CD. I also have technical sales experience with on-prem datacenter
        with not only configuring the solution but presenting them to C-level executives and negotiating deals. I had
        large accounts set varying from 350 to 10,000 accounts generating over <b>200 millions dollars</b>
        which resulted in me humbly receiving <b>2 Dell Inspire Awards</b>. In my sales
        career, the biggest accounts included Google and USA Formula 1 companies.
        Devops, Technical sales & Petroleum Engineering? Yes! I have multiple talents and I am eager to use them all. As
        a detail-oriented
        individual, I possess excellent communication, problem solving, and decision-making skills. I am an avid learner
